# SOLID Principles Training Project

This project is a Java-based application designed to demonstrate the SOLID principles of object-oriented programming.
The SOLID principles are a set of five principles that, when combined together, make it easier to avoid code smells, easily refactor code, and are also part of the agile or adaptive software development.
